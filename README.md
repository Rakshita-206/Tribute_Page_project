# Tribute Page: Dr. Norman Borlaug

This is a simple tribute page I built as part of a web development project. It highlights the life and achievements of **Dr. Norman Borlaug**, an agricultural scientist whose work helped save millions of lives from hunger.

The page includes a short bio, an image with a caption, and a timeline of major milestones in his life. It ends with a quote and a link (currently a placeholder) to his Wikipedia page for anyone who wants to learn more.

## Why this project?

I wanted to practice writing clean HTML and CSS, while also focusing on layout, readability, and accessibility. This project helped me reinforce concepts like:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive design using Flexbox
- Organizing content in a meaningful and visually clear way

## Technologies used

- **HTML5** – for the page structure and content
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout

## What's inside

- `index.html`: the main HTML file
- `style.css`: all the custom styling for layout, typography, and spacing
- `README.md`: this file

- ## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the FreeCodeCamp "Build a Tribute Page" challenge.
- Biography and content adapted from various online sources, especially Wikipedia.

Thanks for checking it out!
